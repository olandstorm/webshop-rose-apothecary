# Rose Apothecary

    We finally moved online. From your favorite small town to the world wide web. Find anything you need from our picturesque store. It's a general store, but it's also a very specific store. It's also not just a store, it's like a place where people can come and get coffee or drinks, but it's not a coffee shop, nor is it a bar. Yeah, it's an environment. And yes, we will be selling things, but it's more like a branded immersive experience.
